Simple pictorial explanations for 2 to 4 year-olds

As parents, we want to communicate with our kids to explain to them why certain things must be done this way or that: why they must hold Daddy's hand while crossing the road; why they must apologize when they push another child; why they have to tidy away their toys, brush their teeth and take a bath; why lying is bad but they should tell aunty that they love the present they hate; and why they should even carry on bothering to ask why when they answer they get is either incomprehensible or "Because Mummy and Daddy Say So (period)".  Teaching kids to understanding why they should do things rather than railroading them into activity after activity fosters a sense of responsibility, self-control and confidence from a young age and is something every parent aspires to.  But it's easier said than done.

This is my idea to help other beseiged parents just a little with this task.  By putting explanations in a pictorial form using pictures and basic symbols such as arrows and crosses, and then talking through them with kids, they can grasp and remember these abstract concepts more quickly.  The goal is to put together a library of commonly used pictures and symbols and a web app which enables parents to quickly combine them to create new explainicons personalized for their children.
